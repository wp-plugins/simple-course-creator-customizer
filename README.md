Simple Course Creator Customizer
=====================

This is an add-on plugin for use with the [Simple Course Creator](https://github.com/sdavis2702/simple-course-creator) plugin.

Simple Course Creator is designed to easily link posts together in a series and output that series list in the content of each included post.

This customizer add-on adds a new section to the WordPress customizer that allows you to make simple design changes to the Simple Course Creator output.

### How It Works
---

Once activated, navigate to the WordPress Customizer and a new section titled "Simple Course Creator Design" will appear near the bottom **only** if Simple Course Creator is installed **and** activated.

All default styles will remain as they were when you install this add-on. Style changes only happen if you change the customizer settings.
